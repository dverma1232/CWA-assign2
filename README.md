# Creating Web Apps - Assignment 2
My second assignment for the creating web apps unit at uni. We had to add to the existing website from the <a href="https://github.com/dverma1232/assign1">previous assignment</a> and make it more interactive and add form validation using Javascript. We also had to add a new page, which would add as a checkout page, therefore it needed to take the info the user entered in enquire.html and store it in local storage and retrieve the information from local storage and display it on the checkout page. There were also a few extra enhancements I added, which included having the full name being prefilled in the card name field, having a countdown timer on the checkout page, so if the transaction wasn't completed in 10 mins, it would clear the local storage and redirect the user to index.html. Another enhancement I added was to hide the textbox for additional comments on the checkout page, if nothing was entered into it from the enquire page, allowing the website to have a cleaner look.
